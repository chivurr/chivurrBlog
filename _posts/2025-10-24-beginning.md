I haven't written, truly written, in a long time. While I've written code (for my job) and written emails and Slack messages (also for my job), those concise, directed uses of language feel far removed from the true meaning of **writing**. Which, in my mind, is to synthesize both the world around us and the world within ourselves. To attempt to showcase a sliver of our perspective, utterly and beautifully unique, to others (and more importantly to ourselves) via a common medium. To lay bare our thoughts and our emotions, what drives us to laugh and cry, what leaves our hearts yearning and what keeps our feet moving towards tomorrow.

Because ultimately as social creatures, our perspective yearns to be let out into the world - to be beholden and understood. And though we have so often been trained by modern society to hold those thoughts and emotions deep within ourselves, I think we owe it to ourselves and those around us to let it out. To speak. To write.

So this is an attempt to get back to that (and away from nonsensical code and business-jargon emails). To capture my thoughts and emotions and channel them into a more tangible form. It's an exercise for myself, but one that I freely leave out for others to engage with. Perhaps someone else will glean something from my writing. Better yet, perhaps someone will decide that they'd like to write too.

I don't know how long this will last, how many posts I will make. But isn't that ultimately true of every other endeavor in my life? One day I will stop streaming. Someday I will play my last game of volleyball, finish DMing my last D&D campaign.

But for now, I see purpose in this site, in this blog.

So for now, I will write.
