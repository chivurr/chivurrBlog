Hey, I'm Chiv/Chivurr (pronounced the same as shiv/shiver)!

I'm a variety streamer on Twitch - I play a bit of everything but platformers, rogue-likes, and generally difficult games are my jam. When I don't play games, I play piano (I'm not trained, so I play by ear mostly).

A few Chiv facts
- I'm a world record holder in an obscure platformer game LASERS (yeah I'm the only run submitted, don't @ me)
- I love both extrememly spicy and extremely sour food
- I can put my feet behind my head
