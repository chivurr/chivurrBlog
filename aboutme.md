Hey, I'm Chiv/Chivurr (pronounced the same as shiv/shiver)

I'm a variety streamer on Twitch - I play a bit of everything but platformers, rogue-likes, and generally difficult games are my jam. When I don't play games, I play piano (I'm not trained, so I play by ear mostly).

And this is my website. For now it's a blog, but maybe it'll be something more someday.

I've got links to socials at the bottom if you want to follow any of those. I don't really post, but hopefully that'll change in the near future.

A few Chiv facts:
- I'm a world record holder in an obscure platformer game LASERS
- I love both extrememly spicy and extremely sour food
- I can put my feet behind my head
